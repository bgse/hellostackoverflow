Example project for demonstration purposes
==========================================

A minimal example project to demonstrate creating and uploading a pip-installable Python package, and by no means
a substitute for `reading the documentation <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages>`, even
if you are in a rush and your cat is on fire.
